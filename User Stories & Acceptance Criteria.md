User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

As a casual player, I want to skip the tutorial, so that I can start playing right away.

C1: There will be a question at the beginning of the game asking the player if they want to skip the cutscenes.  
C2: There will be a question at the beginning of the game asking the player if they want to skip the tutorial.

As a competitive player, I want to have easy access to all the monsters right away, so that I can spend more time on pvp.

C1: There will be some rental monsters only for pvp, but it will be a bit limited to encourage the player to play the main game too.  
C2: This will be one of those games with 3 save files, meaning the player can have a pvp account and an account to play the game.

As a monster collector, I want to see all the types of monsters I collected, so that I can admire it.

C1: There will be a monster book or something like that.  
C2: I will also add a search feature to search for certain monsters.

Reflection:

1. The easiest one to write was the casual player one, since tutorials and cutscenes are different things.  
2. The hardest one was monster collector because it was hard to come up with a second one that was good.  
3. These stories will help me design my game screens later by letting me know what players would want to see in my game.
