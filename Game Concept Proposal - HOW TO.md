# Monster Dominator

| Level 1 | I’m not sure what the name of my game will be yet but it is something to do with monsters. I guess the game title can be called Monster Dominator or something |
| :---- | :---- |
| Level 2 | Core Genre: Action, Adventure Movement & Abilities: Jumping, Flying/gliding Action/Conflict: Boss fights, Hazards, Combat, Avoidance, Survival Structure / Progression: Level-based, Boss towers Aesthetic / Tone: Fantasy, Cartoonish, Atmospheric Challenge Style: StrategyIt will be an adventure game with a lot of turn-based combat. There will be a lot of bosses and challenges and players will need to come up with strategies to defeat them. |
| Level 3 | My game world will take place in a dystopia where greedy people use the powerful monsters for their own gain. The people had traveled from Earth, a planet which they destroyed with their greediness. When they first arrived, they tried to be greedy but they eventually devolved into that. The main character is one person who is encouraged to be greedy like all of the others. They are setting out to use the monsters of the world to make it to the highest of the human food chain. They do whatever they want. |
| Level 4 | The protagonist is purely customizable and not really a specific character. They will be no different from the greedy world around them. The antagonist is trying to make a good change in the world but they are stopped by the protagonist so the world remains greedy. The enemies will be other greedy monster owners or just monsters themselves. Powerful monsters are usually the bosses. |
| Level 5 | People who are monster taming game fans or people who like strategy or people who like collecting monsters would play my game. This game is for all ages. |
| Level 6 | The monsters will be unlocking new moves almost every time they level up so the player has more strategies they can try. There will also be a ton of rewards. There’s also gonna be pvp which will add a ton of conditions like what rarities are allowed. There should be a ton of things that keep the player playing. |
| Level 7 | My game is going to have a lot of unique mechanics compared to other games, such as the way monsters evolve. There are also going to be 8 starters that can be chosen from, but the starters can be caught in the first area in case the player regrets their choice. |
| Level 8 | The two main games that inspired this game are competitive pokemon and Monster Legends. Competitive pokemon introduced mind games, which I want to replace luck as much as possible in the pvp in my game. Even though this game seems pay to win nowadays, this was the first game I played that I really liked. Monster Legends always has 3v3, which I am going to use in my game. All monsters also have a special attack which can be very powerful. |
| Level 9 | I hope players feel tension and excitement when playing my game. |
